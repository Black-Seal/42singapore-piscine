# 42 Singapore's Piscine Assignments

Welcome, Pisciners!

If youâ€™re here, youâ€™re likely swimming in the Piscine at `42 Singapore`.

This repository contains my solutions for the various projects in the Piscine, which I hope will serve as a useful learning resource.

## Introduction

I'm `xliew`, and I was actually part of the second intake for the 42 Singapore `cursus` program.

Due to my academic commitments as a full-time local university student, I've chosen to focus on my university studies for now.

Iâ€™ve compiled all of my Piscine assignments here to support and inspire other Pisciners, just like you.





## Repository Structure

Each assignment is located in its respective folder.

Each folder typically contains:
- **Code files**: Solutions to tasks and exercises, mostly in the form of `.c` files.
- **Documentation**: Explanation of approaches, challenges encountered, and solutions in the `README.md` file, if the questions are difficult.

You will have `weekly exams` on every `Friday`, and I have a special folder called `exams` that contains resources to help you prepare for them.





## How To Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local environment.

```
git clone git@github.com:Black-Seal/42singapore-piscine.git
```

2. **Explore each folder** to review my solutions for each project.

3. **Learn and adapt**: My answers can serve as guidance, but I encourage you to think critically, understand the logic, and attempt the challenges independently.





## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for your own learning purposes only.

Using these solutions to bypass the learning process can hinder your development.

The Piscine is designed to challenge you and build problem-solving as well as soft skills.

I hope you will consider this as a supplemental resource rather than a shortcut.
